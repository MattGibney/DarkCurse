It's with a heavy heart that I announce that Dark Throne is shutting down. The
game has been a source of great enjoyment for me personally over the years and I
feel like a part of me is leaving with the game. It's pretty sad when you think
about it. I've been pretty obsessed with DarkThrone for many, many years. Over
the last year and a half, it's been a particularly big part of my life.

Here's the official announcement added to the new section of the website:

It's sad to see that the servers are being shut down after all this time, though
it's also not entirelly unexpected. Witout any real sources of revenue, there
was only a finite amount of time that things could be kept online. Running the
game at it's peak would have commanded a pretty impressive server bill, but over
the years, as demmand (and revenue) dried up, the owners cut back the resources
to a bare minimum.

To all of my friends in the game. Thank you for playing with me. I hope for your
support as I embark on this new project.
