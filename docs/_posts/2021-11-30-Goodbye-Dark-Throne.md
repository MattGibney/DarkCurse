I've received a lot of positive responses from the players of Dark Throne. I am
grateful for all or them! Knowing that I have your support in a big help and
will keep me motivated to continue working on this project. As I stated before,
this is very much a passion project and something that I intend to work on in my
free time.

I'm planning to put together a rodmap for the development that I will be doing.
I'm shooting fiorst for an alpha release that will allow players to create
accounts and follow along with the development. Please keep an eye out for the
next few updates for more information on that.

I'll also be putting together some more information on the things that I am
planning to build that are different from the Dark Throne we all know and love.
Most of these are quality of live improvements, such as responsive and
accessible pages. But i'll go into a lot more detail in specific posts. If you
have any ideas for things that I should focus on or enhancements over the
original game, I'd love to hear from you, so please get in touch!
