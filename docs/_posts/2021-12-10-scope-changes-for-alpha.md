I'd really like to get to a point as quickly as possible where the game is
playable. I feel like it's more important to focus on a minimal core game that
everyone can enjoy, even if it's limited in features. I could spend months
working on something that is functionally identical to the original game, but
that's not ideal for the players, who have to wait longer.

It's also argualbe that it's more important that we get something simple in
place first that the player base can help to guide as soon as possible. It's one
of the guiding proncipals of the project and one I'm keen to stick to. I would
like the collective voice of the players to be a big part of the driving force
behind the development of the game. For this reason I have revised my
development plan.

The primary gameplay will focus on training units and attacking players. There
will be little room for strategic play at this early stage. Players will receive
the base level of citizens per day. There will be no additional ways to gain
citizens. Players will need to choose wisely which units to train. Players gain
experience by either sucessfully attacking another player or defending from an
attacker.

See what's going into the initial version [here](/devplan).
