It's time for another progress update. I'm making slow and steady progress, things can sometimes feel like they are progressing slowly, especially when
there are days where I can't put any time into the project. But It's important
to always remember that this is a marathon, not a sprint.

It sounds like there a re a couple of devlopers working on making replacements
to Dark Throne. This is great, It seems like there are two different approaches
being taken with these projects. The first is full re-write, similar to this
project. The others are modifying existing games. Both aproaches are valid and
there isn't really a wrong choice. It depends on what the project goals are.

I've received some direct messages from some members of the Dark Curse
community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/BCrdJSpXWg). I'd like to take this
opportunity to provide some more clarity on the goals for this project and
ensure that everyone is clear on what we will have at the end.

### Q: Why start from scratch? Wouldn't it be quicker to buy an existing game and modify it?

Buying websites is a very difficult process, domain names are pretty simple but
entire websites are another matter. Buying an existing game would pose several
challenges. Firstly, there is the simple negotiation process. Agreeing on a
price and moving money is a difficult and risky process. There is a lot of good
faith required in this kind of transaction.

Secondly, anexisting game has an existing player base. When players sign up to a
website, they agree to a number of legal contracts, privacy policy, terms of
service etc. Maintaining these legal agreements adds an entirely new layer of
risk to the prospect. This could be avoided by closing the purchased game and
wiping the data. Doing this does remove the legal issue for the existing
players, but now there are two dead games. There is no gaurantee the players
will return, nor will the original Dark Throne players join it.

The third issue is again tied to legal. GDPR. There are a lot of Dark Throne
players in europe who are subject to GDPR regulations. Migrating data without
first seeking the consent of each player will be a breach of GDPR regulations
which brings a very large fine.

### Q: Are you making a complete clone of Dark Throne?

Yes and No. My initial plans are to work towards something that is functionally
equivalent to Dark Throne. This will mean that everything that previously
existed in Dark Throne will exist in Dark Curse. I am not going to re-create
the exact algorithms that determine XP and Gold rates, but will try to keep
things as close as possible.

My longer term plans are to add more features and functionality to the base
game. All of these features will be voted on by the community. Players will
have the chance to cast their vote. Iff (if and only if) the feature gets a
majority approval, the feature will be implemented. Players will be regularly invited to suggest new features and push proposals to the community at large.
