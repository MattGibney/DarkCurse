In order to have some sembance of game play sooner rather than later. I am
splitting the development into multiple phases. The goal is to have milestones
that can be worked towards.

## Pre-Alpha (Initial Game)

The main focus of this version is to allow players to be able to experience the
code game play. The game itself will be very limited and will mostly only work
with solo play.
