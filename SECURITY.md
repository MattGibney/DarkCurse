## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. Ensure that the vulnerability has not already been patched in `develop`
2. Make sure there isn't already an open Issue related to the vulnerability.
3. Raise an issue. As a minimum, provide the output of `npm audit` or any relevant information to re-produce the vulnerability.
